title: "Phase 3: Full Client/UI Integration"
layout: post
---

In this phase, we are validating full client and UI integration to ensure that the application’s front end communicates correctly with the backend services behind it. The goal is to verify that complete user workflows such as scanning receipts (FR-1, FR-6, FR-7), scanning barcodes (FR-2, FR-6, FR-7), manually adding items and syncing them to the cloud (FR-3, FR-5, FR-12), receiving expiration alerts (FR-8, FR-9), fetching recipe suggestions (FR-11), authenticating users (FR-5), and deleting inventory items (FR-4, FR-5, FR-12) function smoothly from the interface through to the backend. This testing focuses on real user actions and checks that UI events trigger the proper cloud requests, that responses are correctly processed and displayed, and that the tests also meet critical non-functional requirements (NFR-1a, NFR-1b, NFR-2, NFR-3, NFR-4, NFR-8, NFR-9). 

The following table summarizes the key test cases for full client / UI integration, demonstrating how they help verify these functional and non-functional requirements.

# Test Case Skeletons

| Test Case ID | Test Case Objective | Test Case Description | Expected Results |
|--------------|-------------------|---------------------|-----------------|
| **1** | Verify receipt upload triggers OCR and updates UI | User uploads receipt, UI sends to OCR, OCR returns structured items, UI updates inventory list | 1. UI shows “Processing…” while receipt is uploaded and processed.<br>2. OCR endpoint receives the image payload.<br>3. OCR returns structured item data (name, quantity, category).<br>4. UI displays extracted items as new inventory entries. |
| **2** | Confirm barcode scan auto-populates item fields  | User scans barcode, UI sends code to backend, intelligent data processing decoding, UI automatically identifies item | 1. Barcode scanner opens and captures the barcode.<br>2. Barcode decoder receives the scanned code.<br>3. API returns correct product metadata (name, category, estimated expiration). |B
| **3** | Verify offline item creation syncs to cloud and updates UI  | User offline adds item, item stored locally, UI reconnects, sync to cloud, UI reloads with updated cloud state | 1. Item is stored locally while offline.<br>2. When network returns, sync job sends item to cloud.<br>3. Cloud database updates with the correct item and timestamps.<br>4. UI refreshes inventory list reflecting cloud state without duplicates. |
| **4** |  Confirm expiration alert scheduling triggers push notifications | User creates expiring item, backend registers alert, scheduler triggers alert, UI displays push notification | 1. Notification Engine receives item expiration date and user alert preference.<br>2. Alert job is scheduled within <2 seconds of item creation.<br>3. Push notification is delivered near the due time.<br>4. UI displays alert in notifications panel with correct item name and countdown. |
| **5** | Verify recipe suggestion integration displays correct results | User requests recipe suggestions, UI sends ingredients, backend queries recipe API, UI shows recipe results | 1. UI sends filtered ingredient list to backend.<br>2. Backend queries external recipe API (e.g., TheMealDB).<br>3. Cloud returns recipe titles, images, and steps.<br>4. UI displays recipe cards containing the returned data. |
| **6** |  Confirm OAuth/OpenID Connect authentication grants secure access | User opens login screen, enters credentials, UI sends authentication request to OAuth/OpenID Connect server, server validates credentials and issues token, UI stores token and grants access to protected inventory and recipe features | 1. OAuth/OpenID Connect server validates user credentials.<br>2. Access and refresh tokens are returned to the UI.<br>3. UI securely stores tokens (local storage/session storage).<br>4. UI unlocks protected inventory and recipe features.<br>5. UI uses the access token to make authenticated requests to the backend (e.g., inventory sync, recipe retrieval). |
| **7** |  Validate inventory deletion in cloud updates and UI state | User deletes an item, UI sends delete request to cloud, cloud updates DB, UI refreshes to match cloud | 1. Delete request is received by the cloud backend.<br>2. Cloud database removes the item.<br>3. UI refreshes inventory list reflecting the deletion.<br>4. No deleted item remains in the UI or cloud database. |
